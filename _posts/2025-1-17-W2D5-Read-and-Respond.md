[Popular online bill paying site leaks data of thousands of users](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/popular-online-bill-paying-site-leaks-data-of-thousands-of-users)

This article discsses how a security researcher found an unsecured database owned by [Willlow Pays](https://willowpays.com/), a company that helps users pay for things in installments.  
The researcher found hundreds of thousands of records belonging to the customer base of the company, including billing addresses and email addresses. Willow has since secured their databases, but they have yet to reveal if the oversight was their fault, or if they outsourced it to someone else.  

  I think that this is a really embarassing mistake, especially since it comes from a company that deals with a lot of personal information from many different people. At this point, it should be second nature for companies to encrypt their data, especially since they risk public humiliation and loss of trust if the don't.
