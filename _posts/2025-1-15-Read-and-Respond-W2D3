[US removes malware allegedly planted on computers by Chinese-backed hackers](https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/us-removes-malware-allegedly-planted-computers-by-chinese-backed-hackers-2025-01-14/)

The Justice Department has discovered and removed malware from over 4,200 computers. It was installed using infected USBs and was discovered by a French security company in 2023. The malware was dicovered in 2014, and the government now has the tools availible to remove it from the systems.

I'm pretty suprised by the fact that there hasn't been a fix discovered for this malware yet, given how old it is. I think that it probably wouldn't be that difficult to have a firewall or antivirus look for the signs and prevent the hacks.
